bald mountain by one of russia's greatest composers modest mussorgsky the second is franz schubert's world-famous ave maria\" musically and dramatically we have here a picture of the struggle between the profane and the sacred bald mountain according to tradition is the gathering place of satan and his followers here on walpurgnisnacht which is the equivalent of our own halloween the creatures of evil gather to worship their master under his spell they dance furiously until the coming of dawn and the sounds of church bells send the infernal army slinking back into their abodes of darkness and then we hear the ave maria\" with its message of the triumph of hope and life over the powers of despair and death", "the symphony that beethoven called the pastoral\" his sixth is one of the few pieces of music he ever wrote that tells something like a definite story he was a great nature lover and in this symphony he paints a musical picture of a day in the country of course the country that beethoven described was the countryside with which he was familiar but his music covers a much wider field than that and so walt disney has given the pastoral symphony a mythological setting and the setting is of mount olympus the abode of the gods and here first of all we meet a group of fabulous creatures of the field and forest unicorns fawns pegasus the flying horse and his entire family the centaurs those strange creatures that are half man and half horse and their girlfriends the centaurettes later on we meet our old friend bacchus the god of wine presiding over a bacchanal the party is interrupted by a storm and now we see vulcan forging thunderbolts and handing them over to the king of all the gods zeus who plays darts with them as the storm clears we see iris the goddess of the rainbow and apollo driving his sun chariot across the sky and then morpheus the god of sleep covers everything with his cloak of night as diana using the new moon as a bow shoots an arrow of fire that spangles the sky with stars", "and now we're going to hear a piece of music that tells a very definite story as a matter of fact in this case the story came first and the composer wrote the music to go with it it's a very old story one that goes back almost 2,000 years a legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice he was a bright young lad very anxious to learn the business as a matter of fact he was a little bit too bright because he started practicing some of the boss best magic tricks before learning how to control them one day for instance when he'd been told by his master to carry water to fill a cauldron he had the brilliant idea of bringing a broomstick to life to carry the water for him well this worked very well at first unfortunately however having forgotten the magic formula that would make the broomstick stop carrying the water he found he'd started something he couldn't finish", "how do you do my name is deems taylor and it's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here on behalf of walt disney leopold stokowski and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents went into the creation of this new form of entertainment fantasia\" what you're going to see are the designs and pictures and stories that music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists in other words these are not going to be the interpretations of trained musicians which i think is all to the good now there are three kinds of music on this fantasia program first there's the kind that tells a definite story then there's the kind that while it has no specific plot it does paint a series of more or less definite pictures and then there's a third kind music that exists simply for its own sake now the number that opens our fantasia program the toccata and fugue\" is music of this third kind what we call absolute music\" even the title has no meaning beyond a description of the form of the music what you will see on the screen is a picture of the various abstract images that might pass through your mind if you sat in a concert hall listening to this music at first you're more or less conscious of the orchestra so our picture opens with a series of impressions of the conductor and the players then the music begins to suggest other things to your imagination they might be oh just masses of color or they may be cloud forms or great landscapes or vague shadows or geometrical objects floating in space so now we present the toccata and fugue in d minor by johann sebastian bach interpreted in pictures by walt disney and his associates and in music by the philadelphia orchestra and its conductor leopold stokowski", "now we're going to do one of the most famous and popular ballets ever written the dance of the hours from ponchielli's opera

light of noon day as these withdraw a third group enters in costumes that suggest the delicate tones of early evening then a last group all in black the somber hours of the night suddenly the

in the valley beside the brook walked alone and remembered does christmas smell like oranges to you? within a commencement speech such questions were fitting perhaps but hardly the material with which

closing statement to begin with this case should never have come to trial the state has not produced one iota of medical evidence that the crime tom robinson is charged with ever took place it has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant now there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that mayella ewel was beaten savagely by someone who led exclusively with his left and tom robinson now sits before you having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesses his right i have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state she is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man's life at stake which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt now i say guilt, gentlemen because it was guilt that motivated her she's committed no crime she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with she must destroy the evidence of her offense but what was the evidence of her offense tom robinson a human being she must put tom robinson away from her tom robinson was to her a daily reminder of what she did now what did she do she tempted a negro she was white and she tempted a negro she did something that in our society is unspeakable she kissed a black man not an old uncle but a strong young negro man no code mattered to her before she broke it but it came crashing down on her afterwards the witnesses for the state with the exception of the sheriff of maycomb county have presented themselves to you gentlemen to this court in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption the evil assumption that all negroes lie all negroes are basically immoral beings all negro men are not to be trusted around our women an assumption that one associates with minds of their caliber and which is in itself gentlemen a lie which i do not need to point out to you and so a quiet humble respectable negro who has had the unmitigated temerity to feel sorry for a white woman has had to put his word against two white people's the defendant is not guilty but somebody in this courtroom is now gentlemen in this country our courts are the great levelers in our courts all men are created equal i'm no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and of our jury system that's no ideal to me that is a living working reality now i am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence that you have heard come to a decision and restore
